Dovecot, Postfix, MariaDB on Fedora installation instructions and configuration.

A work in progress. I'll have to go through all of the configuration files once
I have things working without TLS.

Postfix is the last part of the puzzle that I need to get working. I think?

## Installation
```bash
sudo dnf install dovecot exim mariadb-server dovecot-mysql exim-mysql
```

## MariaDB
```bash
sudo service mariadb start
sudo mysql_secure_installation
cat mariadb/db.sql | mysql -u root
```

## Dovecot
```bash
sudo cp -R dovecot/* /etc/dovecot
sudo service dovecot start
```

## Postfix
```
sudo cp postfix/* /etc/postfix
sudo postfix reload
```

## Other stuff

Make sure that there's a `vmail` user and group, and also that
`/var/log/mail` is owned by `vmail`.
```
sudo useradd vmail -d /var/spool/mail -s /sbin/nologin
sudo chown -R vmail:vmail /var/spool/mail
```
